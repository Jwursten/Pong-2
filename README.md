Pong 1's game: Pong<sup>2</sup>
# Overview

We were desiring to create a game, purposing to gain experience and spread our horizons. 
Thus we created Pong<sup>2</sup>.

What we have created is the game Pong, but four player. It allows for more people to play the standard 
Pong game, but the layout is redesigned for four people. We also added an extra mode, adding power ups
and abilities to what we call "arcade mode".

# Development Environment

This was primarily done in Godot, which gave us a number of tools to work with. 
Resources used:
- [GoDot](https://godotengine.org/)
- [Git Extention](https://godotengine.org/asset-library/asset/1581)
- [Standard Pong Demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kr1BoEbuveI)


# Future Work

* A lot of effort was spent on multi-computer multiplayer, but it was unsuccessful, so that is a goal for future efforts.
* Another goal is more power ups for Arcade Mode.
* A feature to pause the game would also be high in priority.
